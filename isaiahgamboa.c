/**
The program simulates memory allocation with a chosen hole-fitting algorithm (First-fit,
Best-fit) and implements deallocation and defragmentation. A menu controls the
operations, and each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:
1) Enter parameters
2) Allocate memory for a block using First-Fit
3) Allocate memory for a block using Best-Fit
4) Deallocate memory for a block
5) Defragment memory
6) Quit program and free memory
